`superres-tomo` is a package of useful scripts and models for applying neural networks for tomographic
reconstruction of X-ray images. The package also includes models and scripts useful for the analysis
of the images generated, allowing tasks such as semantic segmentation of very large images and removing
noise from low dose images.

The tasks possible with `superres-tomo` are
    * Image reconstruction
    * Image segmentation
    * Image denoising
    * Image super-resolution [coming soon]
    * Image fusion for super-resolution [coming soon]

`superres-tomo` is a produced in collaboration between the SciML group from Rutherford Appleton Laboratory
and `Finden Ltd <http://www.finden.co.uk>`_. The project has been funded by the  `AI3SD network <http://www.ai3sd.org>`_

The project is also associated with a benchamrk dataset which can be used to test other super-resolution 
approaches on similar data.
