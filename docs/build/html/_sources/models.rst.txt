Models available

This is a list and a brief description of the various models that are currently available 
in `sciml-image`. More detailed information about each of the models can be found in 
their individual module documentaion. Additionally example use cases are provided in the
tutorials.


CNN
###

This module contains a series of simple convolutional neural networks or CNNs. CNNs are the
basis of the majority of the models that are included in `sciml-image`, other models tend to 
be specific instances of CNNs, or CNNs adapted for particular purposes such as image denoising
or segmentation. The CNNs in the CNN module are for simple classification and regression tasks.


AlexNet
#######

AlexNet is a specific instance of a CNN. It became famous in 2012, when it outperformed all of 
the competition in the ImageNet challenge. AlexNet contains eight layers; the first five are 
convolutional layers, some of them followed by max-pooling layers, and the last three are fully 
connected layers. [1]_ It uses the ReLU activation function.

U-Net
#####

The U-net architecture is particularly popular in image segmentation tasks. The model consists
of convolution layers mirrored by deconvolution layers, squeezing down and then reconstructing 
an image of the same size as the original. Doing this a U-Net can convert pixels in the original
image into label values and segment the image. U-nets were initially developed for biomedical 
image segmentation. [2]_
