# super-resolution-ml
Code related to the `Artificial intelligence for reconstruction and super-resolution of chemical tomography` project.

## Intro

This repository contains code for using to neural networks to reconstruct and enhance X-ray tomographs. The networks in this repo are built and tested for tasks in materials science. 

## Contents

* Reconstruction
This directory contains networks that can be used to reconstruct real space images from sinographs.

## Requirements

Requirements for running the codes:
```
PIL
tensorflow >= 2.1
scikit-learn
scikit-image
h5py
astra
matplotlib
imageio
```

## Partners

The project involves [STFC](stfc.ukri.org) and [Finden Ltd.](www.finden.co.uk)

## Funding

This project is funded by the [AI3SD Network](www.ai3sd.org), reference `AI3SD-FundingCall2_017`
